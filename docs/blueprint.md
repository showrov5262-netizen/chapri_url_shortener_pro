## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to convey trust and authority, which aligns with providing professional link management.
- Background color: Very light Indigo (#F0F8FF) provides a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that does not distract from the app's features.
- Accent color: Lilac (#C8A2C8) complements the indigo, provides clear visual contrast, and highlights calls to action. 
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a modern and slightly technical feel appropriate to its technical function. Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, to improve readability for general text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different types of links and actions. All icons should be sourced from the FontAwesome 6 or Heroicons sets.
- Employ a grid-based layout with clear visual hierarchy to present information in an organized and easy-to-navigate manner.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience and provide feedback on interactions.
